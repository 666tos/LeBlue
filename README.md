LeBlue is a Bluetooth LE API for Android that is somewhat easier to use than the standard Bluetooth LE API because it uses a more object oriented approach.

It's accessed through interfaces which means you can use different implementations, for example a mock implementation of an implementation using a vendor specific API.

The API can also be transpiled to work on iOS.
