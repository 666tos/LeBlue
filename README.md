LeBlue
======

LeBlue is a Bluetooth LE API for Android that is somewhat easier to use than the standard Bluetooth LE API because it uses a more object oriented approach.

It's accessed through interfaces which means you can use different implementations, for example a mock implementation of an implementation using a vendor specific API.


Currently however support is limited to discovering devices and listening to characteristic updates.
